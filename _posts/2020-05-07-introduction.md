**Hello friend** I've named this blog LarocheLab, because I want to share my findings and experiences in the world of software development. Also because I thought it was a catchy name :-)

I will focus mainly the world of .NET development but also in ways of devloping software, organise works and teams. It will also be a place for me to store information about various products, libraries and techniques.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="\_blank"} a powerfull static webiste generator.
