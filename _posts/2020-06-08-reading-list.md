_-Stephen King_

I strongly believe in this quote of Stephen King. I've read several blog about software development before I've decided to create one. It helped tremendously to expand my horizon in terms of how to code and design software architecture as well as helping me countless times to find solutions to some issues I was facing. If you're like me, you also like to ponder about the profession and reading developer with a lot of experience who also likes to ponder about software development.
It also has the benefit of improving your writing skill.

With that in mind I've thought of posting my reading of my favorite blog, those that helped me make a better developer as well as entertaining me (sometimes).

            <li>This blog is really good for it's deep dive post about performance optimization in .net core and asp.net core. It's by far one of the best blog about the subject that I've read. There's also good posts about using Azure and AWS with .net and some information about all of the novelty of the asp.net ecosystem.</li>

            <li>Scholar, philosopher, old wise man atop a misty mountain top. When I think about this blog, that's the words that come to my mind to describe it and it's author. The author is (among many other things) the inventor of the Autofixture open-source project which I've used with a lot of fun as well as it saved me some times quite often.

            The blog is packed with a lot of clever observations about software development, be it technical or opinions about the job. I've learned a lot reading this blog and his writing style is direct and to the point. He frequently offers insights which change my mind on a topic or force me to challenge a knowledge I've come to take for granted. Like the time is posted about why having indentation matters to the compiler or interpreter is a good thing. He also made me consider trying functional programming over object oriented because of how well he explained the advantage of functional programming over OOP</li>

            The blog of the self-proclaimed software simplist. Don't judge this blog by it's early 2000 looks. When I think about out of the box approaches, I think about this blog and it's author, Udi Dahan. Having decades of experience in designing enterprise level distributed systems. He promotes services oriented architecture (SOA) done in a way I've never heard before. He's not afraid to challenge so-called best practices in a very opinionated, clever, down-to-earth, get the job done kind of way.
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            I think he's a must read for any aspiring software architect or any experienced one which tackles issues that often repeat themselves when a distributed system is live in production. I would summarize his message like this: designing distributed systems in synchronous blocking request/response is often the root cause of systems failures, asynchronous systems are really worth it and must be considered first. That’s why he created <a href="https://particular.net/nservicebus" target="blank">NServiceBus</a>. And if you don’t like to read, you can watch multiple of his talks for free on youtube.

            <li>The face of the microsoft developers. Scott is an enthusiastic early adopter as well as being an employee of Microsoft and his blog is great to follow because it is often updated with short and to the point posts about new tech for microsoft devs. But there’s a lot more good content too about various things: all encompassing aspects of a developer's life, really cool gadgets and iot devices, how to work remotely in an efficient way, how to blog well and maintain a good social networks presence.</li>

            <li>There’s a lot to learn in best practices and good example, but I think there’s almost a lot to learn from what not to do in seeing atrocious examples of code snippets. It’s also really hilarious to see abominations in production codebase, it helps to share the pain.
