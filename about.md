# About page

Hello friend, my name is Antoine Laroche and I'm a .NET developer based in Quebec City, Canada. I dabbles in other language like javascript (for front end developpment) and python recently.

I have a wide variety of experience in enterprise software developpment, I've worked in big place and small place, in waterfall teams and agile teams, remote from home and in a cubicle farm office. I've been involed in the developpment from scrath of small apps to big distritubed system and also maintaned old legacy code written in vb6, vb.net and even COBOL (gasp).

I love following tech, learning and teaching new things to improve code and shipping nice and useful application.

When I'm not learning about code in my free time I ilke to watch movies and tv series, play videogame and play tabletop roleplaying games with friends and learn about history.
