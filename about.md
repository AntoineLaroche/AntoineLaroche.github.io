# Hello friend,

my name is Antoine Laroche and I'm a .NET developer based in Quebec City, Canada. I dabbles in other language like javascript (for front end development) and python recently.

I have a wide variety of experience in enterprise software development, I've worked in big place and small place, in waterfall teams and agile teams, remote from home and in a cubicle farm office. I've been involved in the development from scratch of small apps to big distributed system and also maintained old legacy code written in vb6, vb.net and even COBOL (gasp).

I love following tech, learning and teaching new things to improve code and shipping nice and useful application.

When I'm not learning about code in my free time I like to watch movies and tv series, play videogames and play tabletop roleplaying games with friends as well as learn about history.
