_-Stephen King_

I strongly believe in this quote of Stephen King. I've read severals blog about software development before I've decided to create one. It helped tremendously to expend my horizon in terms of how to code and design software architecture as well as helping me countless times to find solutions to some issues I was facing. If you're like me, you also like to ponder about the profession and reading developer with a lot of experience who also likes to ponder about software development is.
It also have the benefit of improving your english.

With that in mind I've though of posting my reading of my favorite blog, those of helped me make a better developer as well as entertaining me (sometimes).
